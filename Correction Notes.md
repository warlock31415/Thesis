- Title - Capitalize initial letter
## Introduction
- [x] Missing period in the first paragraph
- [x] Citation is not appearing in order
- [x] Consistent capitalization on Precision Agriculture
- [x] reference 5,8 needs a space between cite and word
- [x] Numbers are words
- [x] Water tension level definition cite
- [x] sensors is unnecessarily capitalized in section 1
- [x] 1.3,reword - there are various challenges in .....(instead of problem)
- [x] $$\epsilon  = \frac{D}{E}$$
- [x] Add assuming non-magnetic 
- [x] equation 1.5 missed $\epsilon'$
- [x] Assuming a lossy medium add equations relating epsilon and the complex 
- [x] Define Power and Voltage in scattering parameters
- [x] "10% or less" for <-10dB 
- [x] Redraw RLC figure
- [x] 1.3.4 - Use "tuned circuit".
	- [x] And resistor due to loss
	- [x] At such frequency points
- [x] Al1.3.5 Use different phrasing. All 
- [x] Outline "AND puts forth"
- [x] change verb to avoid repetition 

## Lit review
- [x] Define FCC
- [x] Add space for units
- [x] an anisotropic
- [x] Convert units to M (2.2) - Water is measured in inches can't use the metric system
- [x] an increased capacitance
- [x] move soil to the end of the sentence last line in 2.2
- [x] Convention for "et al." (2.3)
- [x] Bigger heading (fig 2.2)
- [x] Add temperature assumption
- [x] Move eq 2.3 to intro
- [x] speed of travelling wave - instead of speed of travel
- [x] Section 2.4 - By the best effort of the author... very less info was found

## Objectives and motivation
- [x] As presented in the previous chapter, much research has been done. 
- [x] Permittivity of soil NOT soil's
- [x] Wireless - small "w"
- [x] With the best of the author's effort'
- [x] Based on such collective observation. The knowledge gap that was discovered through 34 research question which this thesis aims to address below


- [x] No need to start with "To"
- [x] Use evaluate instead of "check" (3.3)
- [x] The following assumptions were made during this research work

- [x] USA - (3.4)
- [x] Add "."
- [x] Complex - planar microstrip antennas low profile
- [x] Soil is non-magnetic

- [x] "Environemntal effect" - specific
- [x] rephrase "two antennas...." - Be specific
- [x] S11 in parentheses

## Theory
- [x] much-needed information - needs to be rephrased
- [x] The relative permittivity was measured -- at what temperature
- [x] power being absorbed -- power of what?
- [x] To understand why.... - Rephrase 
- [x] Citations for BCC
- [x] max - Maximum packing efficiency
- [x] Why permittivity of water dominates - Higher water permittivity
- [x] Reason why only <30% is considered.
- At room temperature - last line in 4.1
### 4.2
- [x] Title - Moisture absorption by substrate
- [x] Why is the substrate absorbing moister
- [x] permittivity changes capacitance and changes the resonant point
### 4.3
- [x] remove mono"-"poles
- [x] physical dimension of the antenna is directly.....
- [x] Equation - consistent
- [x] antenna dimension D","
- [x] Use the substrate perspective
### 4.4
- [x] Metamaterial - single word
- What is a fractional frequency
### 4.5 
- [x] Rogers website citation needed
- [x] Move the cement composition to 4.5.1.1
- [x] Size of the sample - find from email
- [x] What is the RO4003 material - PTFE specify from rogers 
- [x] Dimensions are in mm
### 4.6
- [x] The samples were simulated using a full wave simulator
- [x] 90% of the signal is transmitted 
- [x] Although these two look similar there is a difference in where the feed line connects to the elliptical patch
- [x] Matlab code big labels
- [x] picture of the Circut
- [x] retake Cement picture with ruler with contrast backgrounds
## Measurement
- [x] Agilent - Keysight
- [x] Model Number of the equipment
- [x] Add text to what the trapezoid is
- [x] Redo Setup picture with a poster background
- [x] $2\times$ - needs to be 2 "times"
- [x] "Distilled water" was added "room temp"....(5.3)
- [x] Add "No evaporation happens during the experiment" to assumptions
- [x] Less sig figs
- [x] Mention 50$\Omega$ match
- [x] Calibrate VNA till the end of the TL - 2 port SLOT
- [x] In order to measure the effect...m (5.3.2)
- [x] The wights of the antenna before and after the experiments 
- [x] Add S21 in the Appendix

## Results
- [x] Even though .... - incomplete sentence. Add ","
- [x] Use Lost - instead of "wasted"
- [x] This eventually dissipates as heat and makes it propagation of the signal more challenging
  - Avoid first person
  - [x] need equation for plot 
	  - Use Excel
- [x] Path forward - seperate chapter
	- add more stuff
	- change outline in the intro
- [x]  It is clear - It can be concluded that...
