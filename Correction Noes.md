- Title - Capitalize initial letter
## Introduction
- Missing period in the first paragraph
- Citation is not appearing in order
- Consistent capitalization on Precision Agriculture
- reference 5,8 needs a space between cite and word
- Numbers are words
- Water tension level definition cite
- sensors is unnecessarily capitalized in section 1
- 1.3,reword - there are various challenges in .....(instead of problem)
- $$\epsilon  = \frac{D}{E}$$
- Add assuming non-magnetic 
-  equation 1.5 missed $\epsilon'$
- Assuming a lossy medium add equations relating epsilon and the complex 
- Define Power and Voltage in scattering parameters
- "10% or less" for <-10dB 
- Redraw RLC figure
- 1.3.4 - Use "tuned circuit".
	- And resistor due to loss
	- At such frequency points
- 1.3.5 Use different phrasing. All 
- Outline "AND puts forth"
- change verb to avoid repetition 

## Lit review
- Define FCC
- Add space for units
- an anisotropic
- Convert units to M (2.2)
- an increased capacitance
- move soil to the end of the sentence last line in 2.2
- Convention for "et al." (2.3)
- Bigger heading (fig 2.2)
- Add temperature assumption
- Move eq 2.3 to intro
- speed of travelling wave - instead of speed of travel
- Section 2.4 - By the best effort of the author... very less info was found

## Objectives and motivation
As presented in the previous chapter, much research has been done. 
- Permittivity of soil NOT soil's
- Wireless - small "w"
- With the best of the author's effort'
- Based on such collective observation. The knowledge gap that was discovered through 34 research question which this thesis aims to address below
Based on the research questions, the following research objectives are summarized

- No need to start with "To"
- Use evaluate instead of "check" (3.3)
- The following assumptions were made during this research work

- USA - (3.4)
- Add "."
- Complex - planar microstrip antennas low profile
- Soil is non-magnetic

- "Environemntal effect" - specific
- rephrase "two antennas...." - Be specific
- S11 in parentheses

## Theory
- much-needed information - needs to be rephrased
- The relative permittivity was measured -- at what temperature
- power being absorbed -- power of what?
- To understand why.... - Rephrase 
- Citations for BCC
- max - Maximum packing efficiency
- Why permittivity of water dominates - Higher water permittivity
- Reason why only <30% is considered.
- At room temperature - last line in 4.1
### 4.2
- Title - Moisture absorption by substrate
- Why is the substrate absorbing moister
- permittivity changes capacitance and changes the resonant point
### 4.3
- remove mono"-"poles
- physical dimension of the antenna is directly.....
- Equation - consistent
- antenna dimension D","
- Use the substrate perspective
### 4.4
- Metamaterial - single word
- What is a fractional frequency
### 4.5 
- Rogers website citation needed
- Move the cement composition to 4.5.1.1
- Size of the sample - find from email
- What is the RO4003 material - PTFE specify from rogers 
- Dimensions are in mm
### 4.6
- The samples were simulated using a full wave simulator
- 90% of the signal is transmitted 
- Although these two look similar there is a difference in where the feed line connects to the elliptical patch
- Matlab code big labels
- picture of the Circut
- retake Cement picture with ruler with contrast backgrounds
## Measurement
- Agilent - Keysight
- Model Number of the equipment
- Add text to what the trapezoid is
- Redo Setup picture with a poster background
- $2\times$ - needs to be 2 "times"
- "Distilled water" was added "room temp"....(5.3)
- Add "No evaporation happens during the experiment" to assumptions
- Less sig figs
- Mention 50$\Omega$ match
- Calibrate VNA till the end of the TL - 2 port SLOT
- In order to measure the effect...m (5.3.2)
- The wights of the antenna before and after the experiments 
- Add S21 in the glossary

## Results
- Even though .... - incomplete sentence. Add ","
- Use Lost - instead of "wasted"
- This eventually dissipates as heat and makes it propagation of the signal more challenging
  - Avoid first person
  - need equation for plot 
	  - Use Excel
- Path forward - seperate chapter
	- add more stuff
	- change outline in the intro
-  It is clear - It can be concluded that...
